Ray origin:
    R0 = [x0, y0, z0]
Ray direction:
    Rd = [xd, yd, zd]
Set of points on the ray:
    R(t) = R0 + t*Rd, t > 0.0

Ray-Sphere Intersection:
    Sphere center: Sc = [xc, yc, zc]
    Sphere radius: Sr
    Sphere:
        S = {[xs, ys, zs]
                | (xs - xc)^2 + (ys - yc)^2 + (zs - zc)^2 = Sr^2
            }
        
        P | P^2 = r^2 
    Replace the xs, ys, zs with R(t)
        (x0 + xd * t - xc)^2 + (y0 + yd * t - yc)^2 + (z0 + zd * t - zc)^2 = Sr^2
